  // Array below used for @trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports
  // to specify import types order, 
  // from first to last regex in the array
  // sorted in file as top to bottom,
  // on the very top will be placed imports
  // which can`t be found in this array as they
  // considered as node modules imports.
  //
  // regex explanations from first to last:
  // 1: Takes imports which begins with "@/" and NOT ends with one of: svg, png, jpg, jpeg;
  // 2: Takes imports which begins with any symbol AND ends with one of: svg, png, jpg, jpeg;
  // 3: Takes imports which begins with "./" and NOT ends with one of: scss, css, svg, png, jpg, jpeg;
  // 4: Takes imports which begins with "./" AND ends with "css" or "scss";
  //
  // !!Important!!
  // In case of modifying this array, keep in mind that those
  // regular expressions are escaped to be compatible with JSON.
